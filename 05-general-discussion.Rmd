# General Discussion {#general-discussion}

This chapter presents a summary of the research presented in this thesis, followed by its theoretical and methodological implications, and applied implications for Mountain Training and its candidates. Future directions for research are identified and the strengths and limitations of the thesis are discussed. Finally, this chapter concludes with brief personal reflections.


## Summary of Results {#general-discussion-summary-of-results}

This thesis aimed to identify factors that influenced the completion rate of the Mountain Leader qualification. To do so, this project employed mixed-method approach to collect data from both candidates and from staff who had an in-depth knowledge of the Mountain Leader process and its candidates. 

Chapter \@ref(ml-qualitative) reported the findings of seven in-depth interviews with Mountain Training Staff and experienced course staff ([Study 1](#ml-qualitative)). The results in this chapter suggested that different factors were important when considering the two stages main of becoming a Mountain Leader (i.e., getting to an assessment and passing). The findings suggested that candidates who were confident that they could become Mountain Leaders, had an extrinsic participatory motive that was autonomously regulated, were able to gain experience, and were provided with appropriate support were most likely to be assessed. For those candidates who did get to an assessment, their performance would largely be determined by their experience. Candidates who had a variety of relevant experience of the right quality were more likely to pass than candidates who had little relevant experience, little variety in their experience, and low-quality experience. Candidates' experience not only helped them to be more competent through practice, but also helped them to be more confident and resilient.

Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) sought to build on Chapter \@ref(ml-qualitative), by collecting data from candidates about the variables that the findings of Chapter \@ref(ml-qualitative) suggested were important. Following extensive pilot work to develop an appropriate survey tool (see Appendix \@ref(survey-tool-dev)), the results of pattern recognition analyses in Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) provided important discriminatory variables for each of the following classification problems: (a) male candidates who are assessed within 18 months of their training course from those who are not ([Study 2](#male-gta)), (b) female candidates who are assessed within 18 months of their training course from those who are not ([Study 3](#female-gta)), and (c) candidates who pass their first assessment from those who do not ([Study 4](#ftp)). 

[Study 2](#male-gta) suggested that in order to get to an assessment within 18 months of training, it was important that male candidates: could fit becoming a Mountain Leader into their lives and prepare for an assessment, were confident in their ability to become Mountain Leaders and their skills, and were able to deal with setback they might encounter on the way to becoming a Mountain Leader. [Study 3](#female-gta) suggested that in order to get to an assessment within 18 months of training, it was important that female candidates: could fit becoming a Mountain Leader into their lives and prepare for an assessment, were confident in their skills, had extrinsic participatory motives to become Mountain Leaders, and consolidated their experience post-training and prepared effectively for an assessment by accruing good quality and varied experience. [Study 4](#ftp) suggested that it was important that candidates (female and male) received good coaching from training course staff and prepared effectively for an assessment, by gaining experience of suitable quality. These findings supported those of Chapter \@ref(ml-qualitative).

Given that in both Chapter \@ref(ml-qualitative) and Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) it was apparent that both candidates' self-efficacy and experience were important factors in understanding who went onto become Mountain Leaders and who did not, the likely link between the two factors, and the apparent gender differences, Chapter \@ref(self-efficacy-qmds) aimed to better understand the effects of candidates' gender and experience on their self-efficacy. To do so, we used data collected for the work reported in Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) and Appendix \@ref(survey-tool-dev). In [Study 5](study-5), we developed the MLSS to measure self-efficacy for skills related to becoming a Mountain Leader. [Study 6](study-6) had two aims, firstly to confirm the factor structure of the MLSS in a new sample and secondly, to examine the additive and interactive effects of gender and experience on self-efficacy.

The MLSS measures two factors: self-efficacy to perform routine skills and self-efficacy to perform emergency skills. Measurement invariance analyses suggested that the MLSS measured the same factors in female and male candidates, however there was evidence in [Study 6](study-6) that female and male candidates had different scores on the factors, although the factor structure and item-factor loadings were no different between genders. In [Study 6](study-6), the results of moderated hierarchical regression analyses suggested that female candidates were less confident than male candidates, candidates with more experience were more confident, and the relationship between experience and routine skill self-efficacy was stronger for female candidates than it was for male candidates.


## Theoretical and Methodological Implications

### A Methodology for Researching Development Pathways

One implication of this thesis is that factors influencing Mountain Leader candidates are multifaceted and complex; there is no "silver bullet" that determines, or even influences, the completion of the Mountain Leader qualification. This adds to a body of research that recommends researchers take a holistic approach when considering journeys through pathways [e.g., @Jones2019a; @Hardy2017]. Further, this thesis also shows that different factors are important at different stages of the Mountain Leader pathway. Therefore, if trying to improve one step of a training pathway, it should be done considering the broader picture, so that it does not create or exacerbate problems later in the pathway. Thus, I recommend that the term "holistic" is viewed as meaning at least multidisciplinary and temporally.

The broad methodology used in this thesis provides a framework for those wishing to examine complex questions involving a large number of variables using a survey methodology. This methodology extends that of other researchers who have used pattern recognition analyses to understand complex journeys through pathways [e.g., @Jones2019a; @Jones2020; @Gullich2019], where data collection has relied interview-based methods to collect data, placing a considerable burden on participants. The methodology of this thesis does not necessarily reduce the overall burden on participants; however, it could be viewed as spreading the same total burden over a greater number of participants, through the extensive preliminary work, thereby reducing the burden on each individual participant. This preliminary work (reported in Appendix \@ref(survey-tool-dev)) involves a qualitative enquiry coupled with a review of relevant literature to identify potentially relevant factors, finding suitable short-form measures for each factor, and finally ensuring that the resultant survey is of reasonable length, using empirical methods to reduce the length if necessary. I do not propose that the methodology used in this thesis supersedes that of studies using interview-based methods, rather it provides researchers with another tool. Indeed, there will be some situations where interview-based methods are preferable to survey-based methods (e.g., when the population is small).


### Gender differences in the Relationship Between Experience and Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy theory has suggested that performance accomplishments are the strongest influence on efficacy beliefs [@Bandura1982]. Chapters \@ref(ml-qualitative), \@ref(ml-pra), and \@ref(self-efficacy-qmds) all add to the body of evidence that suggests that support this [e.g., @Anstiss2018; @Chase2003; @Samson2014; @Shipherd2019]. In Chapters \@ref(ml-qualitative) and \@ref(ml-pra) we tentatively suggested that the relationship between self-efficacy and experience may not be the same for the two genders considered in this thesis. However, to the best of my knowledge, there is no published research that directly examines *both* the additive and interactive effects of gender and experience on self-efficacy. Therefore, the research reported in Chapter \@ref(self-efficacy-qmds) examined the additive and interactive effects of gender and QMDs (experience) on two factors of Mountain Leader self-efficacy (routine and emergency skills). The results of Study 6 suggested that the relationship between experience and routine skill self-efficacy was stronger for female candidates than it was for male candidates. While the underlying mechanism for this interactive effect as not explored, the implication remains the same; female candidates need more experience to feel confident than male candidates do.

Given the stronger relationship between experience and routine skill self-efficacy for female candidates, it seems important that they leave the training course with a clear understanding of what they should do to gain more experience. Whereas for male candidates, their development plans may focus more on how to fit the preparation into their lives as a greater number of factors relating to the context of the Mountain Leader qualification within candidates lives were important for discriminating male candidates who were assessed within 18 months of their training course than were important for female candidates. 


## Applied Implications {#gen-discussion-applied-implications}

This section presents some potential applied implications of this thesis that may be useful for Mountain Training to consider in addition to those presented in Section \@ref(ml-pra-applied-implications) and Section \@ref(self-efficacy-applied-implications). Whilst some of the applied implications mentioned below may be of interest to Mountain Training, or indeed to other organisations, when thinking about their other qualifications it is important to consider that the factors identified as important for the Mountain Leader may not be the most important for other training pathways. Given that the largest drop-off of candidates is between training and assessment and that many of the factors identified as important in this thesis are about what candidates do in that period, the recommendations will focus on that period. Some of these implications would be relatively simple to act on, whereas others would require more work to act upon. Therefore, we present *quick wins*, which represent what we believe to be relatively low-effort interventions and *long-term goals*, which are goals that we believe would take more effort to achieve but would ultimately prove worthwhile.

As mentioned above, it is important that both the factors influencing candidates getting to assessment and the factors influencing assessment outcome are considered together in any intervention designed to increase the completion rate if Mountain Training wish to have the maximum positive impact on the completion rate of the Mountain Leader qualification. If only factors influencing candidates getting to assessment are considered, this may result in an increase candidates who are not competent enough to pass a Mountain Leader assessment being assessed and thereby reducing the pass rate (e.g., if an intervention that helped candidates gain experience was successful, but did not ensure that experience was of suitable variety and quality).


### Quick Wins

Below are examples of how providing additional information to candidates could provide quick wins for Mountain Training. Firstly, providing more information about the Mountain Leader qualification to candidates at the point of registration to help them understand the purpose and standard of the Mountain Leader qualification so that they can decide if it is the right level for them. Secondly, explaining to candidates the importance of relevant experience and how it will benefit them so that they can use their time effectively.

In [Study 1](#ml-qualitative), the findings in Section \@ref(ml-qualitative-gta-understanding-the-standard) suggested it was important that candidates understood "the standard" of the qualification so that they understood how confident they needed to be in their skills. In addition, Section \@ref(ml-qualitative-gta-redirection-lower) suggested that having attended a Mountain Leader training course, staff recommend that some candidates pursue a lower level qualification (e.g., Hill and Moorland Leader) as that would be a more reasonable objective for them than the Mountain Leader qualification. In [Study 2](#male-gta) we suggested that some male candidates may be attending a training course to understand more about the qualification (see Section \@ref(context)) and presumably, having learnt more about the qualification, a proportion of these candidates decide not to continue to assessment. Therefore, I believe that providing this information would help candidates to choose the right course for them, reducing the number of candidates attending a Mountain Leader training course somewhat speculatively and potentially increasing the number of candidates registering for the lower level qualifications. In addition, this information would help candidates understand what they needed to do to become a Mountain Leader which would help them prepare effectively.

This thesis provides evidence that gaining relevant experience increases candidates' self-efficacy (see Section \@ref(qual-gta-confidence) and [Study 6](#study-6)) and can develop candidates' resilience (see Section \@ref(qual-passing-resilience)). In addition, Section \@ref(ml-qual-pass-exp) describes the importance of this experience being varied and of suitable quality. Explaining the benefits of relevant experience to candidates and helping them to understand how experience provides these benefits should help candidates to make the most of their consolidation. For some candidates this may result in them doing less, however what they do could be more focused, thus making it easier for them to fit preparing for a Mountain Leader assessment into their lives. 

Traditionally Mountain Training has relied on the written word to convey information to candidates. Below is a novel suggestion for providing candidates with information about QMDs in what could be a more engaging format that could also be useful in explaining the nuances of the QMD definition. The advent of the quantified and shareable self through the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology, digital mapping and digital media provides the opportunity to show candidates examples of QMDs that are overlaid on a digital topographical map^[This link provides an example of a route being overlaid on a digital map, albeit a bike ride on road https://www.relive.cc/view/vJOKXWoyK56] and at important junctures throughout the day, brief segments of video could be used to explain what about that juncture means that it counts as a QMD. Indeed, it would also be possible to discuss changes to the day that would have meant it was not a QMD.


### Long Term Goals

Long term goals based on this thesis for Mountain Training could include: developing a systems for creating individualised consolidation plans for candidates who have been trained, identifying candidates who lack confidence and offering individualised support to bolster their confidence, and using CMS to introduce candidates who may benefit from meeting other candidates (e.g., to prepare together). Each of these goals would aim to help candidates to make the most of their consolidation period. Therefore, these three goals should help Mountain Training increase the proportion of candidates who have attended a Mountain Leader training course that go on to become Mountain Leaders.


#### Development Plans.

In [Study 1](#ml-qualitative), participants explained that they felt it was important candidates left their training course with a good understanding of what they---as an individual---needed to do to prepare for an assessment (Section \@ref(qual-gta-development-plan)). Lack of time was identified as a barrier to gaining enough experience to be assessed in Study 1 (Section \@ref(qual-gta-lack-of-time)). Furthermore, in Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) female and male candidates who were not assessed within 18 months of their training course were more likely than candidates who were assessed within 18 months of their training course to report that becoming a Mountain Leader was less important than other life goals and they were also more likely to report that they did not have enough time to become a Mountain Leader (Study 2 Section \@ref(female-gta-results) and Study 3 Section \@ref(ml-pra-male-gta-key-features) for female and male candidates respectively). In Study 1 (Section \@ref(ml-qual-pass-exp)) participants suggested that the variety and quality of a candidate's experience is more important than the quantity of experience to the outcome of their assessment. This was supported by the results of Study 4 (Section \@ref(ftp-results)), where candidates who included experience below the standard for the Mountain Leader qualification in their logbook were less likely to pass and candidates who included experience above the standard were more likely to pass. 

Considering these findings in combination, it seems that time is a precious resource for Mountain Leader candidates and that helping them to make the most of the time they have available is extremely important. I suggest that ensuring candidates leave their training course with a written development plan for their consolidation that describes how, within the context of their life, they can best prepare for an assessment would help candidates prepare *effectively and efficiently* for an assessment, thus increasing the completion rate of the Mountain Leader qualification. Goal setting theory would suggest that these plans should: include short- and long-term goals; include a combination of outcome, performance, and process goals; consider the individual situation and needs of the candidate; have the opportunity for feedback on goal progress; have review points scheduled (either by time or event); and importantly should have input from both the candidates and training course staff [cf. @Gould2005; @Weinberg2014]. 

#### Course Staff Training.

The staff on a Mountain Leader training course are in a position to have a significant impact of a candidate’s journey through the pathway. Chapters \@ref(ml-qualitative) and \@ref(ml-pra) both discus staff behaviours that can positively influence candidates (e.g.,  through goal setting and fostering autonomous motivation). Further, research suggests that it is by training those in leadership positions (e.g., course staff) it is possible to improve their leadership behaviours and their subjects self-confidence, resilience, satisfaction, and their likelihood of completing a training pathway [@Hardy2010]. Therefore, it would seem prudent to provide training to Mountain Training course staff, informed by this research, to develop their coaching skills to maximise the positive impact that they can have on candidates' journeys through the Mountain Leader pathway.

#### Reviewing Assessment Prerequisites.

The results presented in this thesis suggest that difficulty gaining experience is one of the main barriers to candidates becoming Mountain Leaders. The main prerequisite for assessment related to candidates' experience is, "You must have logged a minimum of 40 Quality Mountain Days in three different regions of the UK and Ireland" [@MTUK2015a, p 6]. However, results of Study 1 suggest that quality and variety seem to be more important than quantity of QMDs and that some candidates were competent despite having fewer than 40 QMDs (Section \@ref(ml-qual-pass-exp)). Further, in Study 4 we discussed the fact that the only reason that `r papaja::printnum(100*7/23)`% of candidates in the analysis did not pass their first assessment was because they had too few QMDs (Section \@ref(study-4-preparation-for-assessment)). 

Based on these findings, Mountain Training may wish to review their prerequisites for attending an assessment course. It is possible that providing prerequisites that were more prescriptive about the quality and variety of experience would allow the quantity of QMDs required to be reduces, thereby making it more attainable goal for some. Given the importance of candidates knowing what they need to do in order to prepare for a Mountain Leader assessment, more prescriptive prerequisites may also help candidates prepare effectively for an assessment. However, this suggestion should be taken as just that, a suggestion. Conducting the interviews and being embedded with Mountain Training for the best part of four years has given me an understanding of QMDs and the perception of them by the Mountain Training network (e.g., staff, providers). The vagueness of the definition is somewhat deliberate, allowing it to be interpreted differently to accommodate the wide ranges of experience that different candidates will have and there is a perception amongst the Mountain Training network that once a candidate has gone through the process of becoming a Mountain Leader, they will appreciate this vagueness. Whilst I appreciate this sentiment, the "when you know, you know" approach is not necessarily helpful to candidates who are trying to prepare for an assessment.

Given the importance of QMDs and their current definition to Mountain Training, the importance of candidates understanding what they need to do to prepare effectively for an assessment, the fact some candidates are able to successfully complete the practical element of an assessment course with fewer than 40 QMDs, the apparent difficulty some candidates have gaining the necessary experience to attend an assessment, and the overarching aim of this project (i.e., to find ways in which Mountain Training can improve the completion rates of the Mountain Leader qualification) Mountain Training could consider, or even pilot, an alternate set of experience based criteria for attending assessment. Given the greater relative importance of variety and quality of experience, this alternate set of criteria could reduce the quantity criterion, thus making it more attainable for those with limited time available to prepare for an assessment but provide more specific criteria for the quality and variety of this experience. 

For example, candidates may need to gain additional experience after their training course that includes three graded scrambles, evidenced navigation away from the path, evidenced experience in bad weather. Further, they may be required to gain this experience in at least two of the main mountainous regions (i.e., Scottish Highlands, the Lake District, and Snowdonia). If this additional experience were to be set at 10 days in total, it means that a candidate who could spend five days a year gaining QMDs would be able to get from training to assessment in two years, rather than four. As shows in Figure \@ref(fig:survival-sex), the likelihood of a candidate being assessed four years post training is much lower than the likelihood of them being assessed two years post training.

It is important to note that this suggestion is meant to increase the proportion of candidates who become Mountain Leaders having attended a trainman course and is not meant to lower the standard of candidates who get to assessment. To borrow a phrase from a similar stream of research, this is meant to "train [candidates] in, not select out" [@Hardy2014d]. Therefore, to test the efficacy of this suggestion, Mountain Training should pilot the alternate criteria alongside the current ones, thereby offering two routes to assessment. This would allow them to observe the proportion of candidates who get to an assessment via each route, which would show if the new criteria did make assessment more accessible. It would also allow Mountain Training to monitor the pass rate for candidates, as it may be important to ensure that the overall pass rate did not decrease and to ensure that candidates who got to assessment via the new criteria were suitable prepared and experienced for assessment.


#### Supporting Access to the Mountains.

A barrier to completion identified in \@ref(qual-gta-gaining-experience) was living further away from the mountains (Section \@ref(qual-gta-location)). Travel time to the mountains was an important feature for discriminating candidates who passed their first assessment from those who did not, and we suggested that living further from the mountains was a reason for some candidates logging experience below the standard of the Mountain Leader qualification. As previously discussed, experience below the standard is unlikely to effectively prepare candidates for a Mountain Leader assessment. Therefore, identifying and supporting candidates who have difficulty accessing the mountains may help them to gain enough experience of sufficient quality to become Mountain Leaders. 

This support could be provided at two levels, firstly, direct support could be offered to candidates who are registered for the Mountain Leader qualification if they are identified as having difficulty accessing the mountains. If these candidates are geographically dispersed, then travel bursaries may help them to join up public transport links with more expensive forms of transport (e.g., taxis). However, if these candidates are located near one another, it might be possible to try and develop a community transport system. Secondly, if there are candidates who have difficulty accessing the mountains, it is likely that there are other people, including those who are not registered for the Mountain Leader qualification, who also find it difficult to access the mountains. Therefore, identifying the latent demand for access to the mountains and improving the travel provision to the mountains may have a greater positive impact than just helping candidates to become Mountain Leaders.


#### Changes to DLOG.

This implication is somewhat speculative, but given that the causal attributions made by a candidates about their experience are likely to affect the change in efficacy that results from the experience, trying to influence these causal attributions may reduce the negative impact that experiences perceived as failures have on self-efficacy and increase the positive influences of success [cf. @Rees2005]. Mountain Training's DLOG facility provides an interesting opportunity to do so. Candidates could be required to provide information about their experience, additional to that already required, to encourage them to frame the experience in a positive manner. For example, @Seligman2005 showed that an online intervention that required participants to write three good things about their day for a week along with their perceived causal attributions for each good thing increased happiness and decreased depressive symptoms for six-months. Taking the principle of this study, it is conceivable that asking candidates to write three good things about the experience they are logging, and their causal attributions could be used to help them frame it in a positive manner.


## Strengths and Limitations {#general-discussion-strenghts-limitations}

### Limitations {#general-discussion-limitations}

The main limitation of this thesis is that most of the work relies on retrospective methods, thus making the design weak with regard to causality. However, collecting data from multiple sources allowed us to triangulate the findings, additional confirmatory and prospective analyses in Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) supported the findings of the main analyses, and importantly, the interpretation of results has been theoretically driven. It should however be noted that these interpretations reflect my understanding of sports psychology and that there are likely other  plausible explanations for the results reported. @Box1976 stated that, "All models are wrong" and suggested that scientist should seek "simple but evocative models" and "be alert to what is importantly wrong." I would suggest that the models presented in this thesis are simple and evocative, in that they resonate with both the research team and Mountain Training, and I do not believe them to be importantly wrong. A related limitation is the lack of any intervention based or experimental studies. Both of which would have been beneficial for validating the studies reported in this thesis and would have been beneficial for developing a broad research experience. However, the development and use of the methodology in this thesis have allowed me to develop a wide range of skills, most notably the use of advanced and complex statistical analyses.

A final noteworthy limitation is the representativeness of candidates who provided data for this project. As discussed in Chapter \@ref(ml-pra), retrospective responses to the survey were not representative of the wider populations. Candidates who had not been assessed or who had not passed their first assessment were less likely to respond to the survey. The nature of most research is similar, in that it is not always possible to collect data from everyone that one would like to. However, it is significant that the survey which collected data for Chapter \@ref(ml-pra) included data from 15.35% of population who met the inclusion criteria. Indeed, even if this thesis was only relevant to 15.35% of the candidates, it would be noteworthy. Furthermore, the results of Chapter \@ref(ml-qualitative) support those of Chapters \@ref(ml-pra) and \@ref(self-efficacy-qmds), therefore I believe that it is highly likely that the findings are generalisable beyond the 15.35% despite the bias of the sample towards those who are assessed and do pass.

### Strengths {#general-discussion-strengths}

There are several strengths to this thesis. Firstly, it provides the first investigation into the completion rates of the Mountain Leader qualification and did so in a holistic manner, making use of various existing bodies of research in conjunction with the domain specific knowledge of Mountain Training and the research team. The methodology provided a rigorous investigation and I believe that this has resulted in robust findings. More specifically, the multi-source mixed-methods approach allowed us to triangulate the findings as well as explore the nuances of the data. In addition, the state-of-the-art statistical techniques have allowed this research to overcome the limitations of the traditional linear analytical approaches normally applied to similar research. Further, this thesis is based on a significant quantity of both qualitative and quantitative primary data. As mentioned above, the congruence of the qualitative and quantitative data supports the generalisation of this thesis' findings to the wider Mountain Leader population.

### Future Research Directions

Several ideas for future research are discussed in Section \@ref(ml-pra-future-directions) and Section \@ref(chapter-4-future-directions). In addition to these, it would seem prudent for Mountain Training to consider what factors are important for the completion of other Mountain Training qualifications, given that the candidates drop-off is similar for all qualifications \@ref(fig:qual-pathway-drop-off-plot). Understanding which factors are similar for other qualifications, says something about the generic training pathway and which factors are different would tell us something about developing different levels of expertise/performance and would therefore be of interest to both Mountain Training and the wider community of researchers and practitioners.


## Conclusion {#general-discussion-conclusion}

The conclusions of this research can be presented in a relatively simple manner; Mountain Training's Mountain Leader qualification pathway is effective and candidates who want to become Mountain Leaders and can fit the preparation into their life will achieve their goal, whilst those who do not or cannot, will not achieve theirs. However, this thesis highlights the importance of the consolidation period for candidates and provides some evidence-based recommendations for ways that Mountain Training could provide additional support to candidates, with the aim of increasing the completion rate without reducing the standard of Mountain Leaders.
