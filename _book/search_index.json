This paper builds on a large qualitative study reported in Chapter 2, the aim of which was to identify factors that may influence the completion of the Mountain Leader qualification (ML). From the results of that study, it was clear that there was no single factor that influenced completion, but instead the results suggested that a myriad of factors are important and there are multiple interactions between them. 3.1.1 The Mountain Leader qualification The ML is a qualification for “people who want to lead groups in the mountains, hills and moorlands of the UK and Ireland” (Mountain Training UK 2015). To become an ML, candidates must complete a training pathway, involving four distinct steps, which have remained broadly similar since 1954 when the qualification was created. Something about projects in other countries being based on the ML - UIAA w/Steve Long To qualify, candidates must first register for the qualification and gain a minimum of 20 Quality Mountain Days (QMDs)1, then they complete a six day training course, following that they are required to gain a minimum of 20 additional QMDS as further experience to consolidate skills, and finally they need to successfully complete a five day assessment course. Therefore, to become an ML, one must spend a minimum of 51 days in the mountains. Most successful candidates will have more experience than this, whether that is additional QMDs, experience of mountain walking that does not meet the QMD criteria, or other mountaineering experience. Becoming an ML requires candidates to commit a significant amount of time and money in order for them to qualify as MLs. Between 2009 and 2018 an average of 2278 candidates registered for the ML qualification each year, but only 559 qualified. When looking more closely at the numbers of candidates who did qualify it became clear that there are two main components to qualifying: 1) getting to an assessment and 2) passing an assessment. Interestingly, most candidates who got to an assessment passed their first assessment (Figure 3.1), but most candidates did not get to an assessment (Figure 3.2). It is also noteworthy that, as shown in Figure 3.2, becoming an ML is not a quick process, the mean time from training to assessment was 1.57 years. Mountain Training UKI would like to understand why people do not complete the ML qualification and identify if there are any changes to the pathway that they can make in order to better support their candidates. It is unlikely that there is a single factor that would be a “silver bullet” to improve completion rates. Instead there are likely a myriad of factors which influence completion at various stages of the pathway. Some of these factors will be generic to all candidates, whilst some may be specific to individual (groups of) candidates.

Having a combination of factors that influence an outcome is not unique to becoming an ML. Recently there have been a number of projects, in the sport domain, that have tried to find the most important factors in the development of athlete in elite pathways. Examples of projects that have sought to identify the most important discriminatory variables for pathways are: The Great British Medallist Project (GBM; Güllich et al. 2019; Hardy et al. 2017; Rees et al. 2016); “Game Changers” Discriminating Features within the Microstructure of Practice and Developmental Histories of Super-Elite Cricketers (B. D. Jones et al. 2019; B. D. Jones 2019). 3.1.3 This paper We identified 166 variables that were deemed as potentially important to the completion of the ML qualification in a large qualitative study (see results of Chapter 2 LINK?? APPENDIX) and a workshop with the Mountain Training UKI council. We wanted to collect quantitative data from candidates for these variables This manuscript has three studies in it: Item selection Item reduction Model identification How will this look for the thesis vs a manuscript? And does it matter? Write as thesis chapter 3.2 Study 3 - Identifying the most important factors The aim of this project was to identify variables that influence completion of the ML qualification. In the preceding studies, we created a survey tool of reasonable length to collect data for potentially important variables. In this study, we used this survey tool to collect data in order to identify the most important discriminatory variables. In this study we aimed to identify a feature subset for each of the following classification problems: Male candidates who are assessed 18 months after their training from those who are not. Female candidates who are assessed 18 months after their training from those who are not. Candidates who pass their first assessment from those who do not. This results for study are therefore presented in three sections, one for each of the classification problems above. 3.2.1 Method 3.2.1.1 participants table Table 3.1: Participant descriptive statistics. Sex n Age white Assessed Assessed within 18 months Passed first time Female 246 NA 219 (89%) 71 (28.9%) 61 (24.8%) 59 (83.1%) Male 502 39.4 446 (88.8%) 187 (37.3%) 171 (34.1%) 159 (85%) 3.2.1.2 Participants A separate sample of ML candidates were used for this study. We contacted all candidates who attended their first ML training course in 2017 or 2018, inviting them to participate in the study, 1030 candidates started the survey and 440 completed the survey (15.35% response rate). Of the 440 responses, 155 were from female candidates (\\(M\\)age = 36.02 ±11 years) and 285 were from male candidates (\\(M\\)age = 40.88 ±12.75 years). These candidates had been trained by 70 different providers and those who had been assessed, had been assessed by 52 different providers. When responding to the survey, candidates would have been at different stages in the pathway. Some candidates responded to the survey prior to an assessment and other responded having been assessed, some candidates would also have completed their training course at least 18 months before responding to they survey and the remainder would have been responding to the survey within 18 months of their training course (see Table 3.2 for a summary). In this study we analysed the data for getting to assessment within 18 months of training from female and male candidates separately as the completion rates for each group are different2. Each of the analyses had different inclusion criteria and subsequently, used a different subset of candidates. Details of the candidates included in each data set are presented in the sections below. Table 3.2: Candidates pathway progress when completing the survey. Sex Assessment 18 months post-training n Female post post 12 pre 22 pre post 19 pre 102 Male post post 36 pre 55 pre post 35 pre 159 3.2.1.2.1 Getting to assessment within 18 months of training - Male candidates There were 71 responses from male candidates who completed the survey more than 18 months after their training course (i.e., retrospectively), 6 of whom had been assessed more than 18 months post-training3, 33 of whom had been assessed within 18 months of their training course and 32 who not been assessed at the time of completing the survey4. Therefore, we were able to create a set of training data (\\(n\\) = 54), which we could use to select variables and a set of test data (\\(n\\) = 10, with an equal split of candidates who had and had not been assessed). In addition to this, 164 male candidates completed the survey less than 18 months after their training but at the time of writing were at least 18 months post-training. These candidate formed the validation data set. 3.2.1.2.2 Getting to assessment within 18 months of training - Female candidates The data used for this analysis were collected from 27 candidates who had been assessed 18-months after their training (\\(M\\)age = 36.26 ± 11.05 years) and 27 who had not (\\(M\\)age = 37.98 ± 11 years). We received fewer responses from female candidates, therefore we combined the retrospective and prospective data as neither group would be large enough on its own. In each group there were 10 candidates who completed the survey retrospectively (i.e., &gt; 18 months post-training) and 17 who completed the survey prospectively (i.e., 12-18 months post-training). 3.2.1.2.3 Passing first time The data used for this analysis were collected from 46 candidates, 34 of whom had been assessed prior to completing the survey and 12 of whom had not been assessed before completing the survey. As with the data in female candidates getting to assessment, we combined the retrospective and prospective data to increase the sample size5. Twenty three of the 46 candidates passed their assessment first time. Of the 23 who did not pass, 6 completed the survey prospectively. Two of the 23 candidates who did not pass withdrew from their first assessment, none failed, and the remainder were deferred. Seven of those who were deferred only needed to log additional days. Figure 3.3: Study 3 participants. For simplicity, candidates who have not been assessed have not been added to this figure as a final group, therefore it can be assumed that candidates not progressing from one node to another have not been assessed. Make sure the numbers add up - they don’t at the moment, I think this is because of the removal of candidates/variables 3.2.1.3 Measures The survey tool developed in Study 2 was used to collect data. See Table 3.7 for a full list of variables included in the survey. 3.2.1.4 Procedure 3.2.1.5 Analytical method In this study we were interested in identifying the best combination of discriminatory variables and as such, we used a similar but different method to the one used in Study 2. The three steps were the same, but the way in which we created the data sets and some of the technical specifications for the parameters in the algorithms were different. 3.2.1.5.1 Preprocessing For each classification problem, the ideal way to perform the analyses would be as follows: Given \\(N\\) cases, randomly select \\(x\\), where \\(\\frac{N}{3} &gt; x &gt; \\frac{N}{10}\\) cases for each category of the criterion variable to be held-out as a test data set \\(D_{test}\\) and the remaining candidates become the training data \\(D_{train}\\). Prepare both the \\(D_{train}\\) and \\(D_{test}\\) data sets separately (e.g., standardising the data). Perform the feature selection process using \\(D_{train}\\). Carry out the classification process using \\(D_{train}\\) using k-fold cross validation. Carry out the classification process on \\(D_{test}\\) using \\(D_{train}\\) to train the classification model. Using the same data to train and test a model leads to the risk of over-fitting and classification rates being artificially inflated as all of the data has been “seen” during the feature selection stage. This phenomenon is know as “peeking” (Kuncheva and Rodríguez 2018; Reunanen 2003; Smialowski, Frishman, and Kramer 2010) and can be mitigated by holding some data out of the feature selection stage (i.e., \\(D_{test}\\)). 3.2.1.5.2 Feature selection Feature section in this study was carried out in a similar fashion to that in Study 2, however we made three changes. The first and most substantive change was the way that decentralisation for feature selection was carried out. For this study, features were vertically distributed (i.e., split by features and not by case; Bolón-Canedo, Sánchez-Maroño, and Alonso-Betanzos 2015). For each classification problem we created seven disjoint feature subsets (for a list of survey variables in each subset see Table 3.7). The second change was the use of the Fast Based Correlation Filter (FCBF; Yu and Liu 2003) instead of CFS; FCBF is a more conservative subset evaluator than CFS. A final minor difference, is that we used the \\(k = 6\\) for the Relief-f algorithm. We then carried out the feature section process as described in Study 2 on each of the feature subsets above as well as the full set of features, resulting in at least two feature subsets, one for variables selected by at least two FS algorithms (2s) and one for variables selected by at least three FS algorithms (3s), for each of the feature (sub-)sets. Where there were at least five variables selected by all four FS algorithms we also retained that feature subset (4s). We then created three sets of omnibus feature subsets for each classification problem where each of the 2s, 3s, and 4s were combined to form a previously unseen feature subset; an example of the omnibus features subsets for getting to assessment is presented in @ref(??). 3.2.1.5.3 Initial classification We performed a classification experiment for each of the classification problems using WEKA’s Experiment Environment (Bouckaert et al. 2018; Frank, Hall, and Witten 2016). For each feature subset identified in the FS stage the training data were classified using LOO-CV and the same four classification algorithms as in Study 2 across 10 runs. This process returned a mean classification rate for each feature subset and classifier. 3.2.1.5.4 Final classification 3.2.1.5.5 Model selection The feature selection process yielded 28 getting to assessment models for both male and female candidates and 26 first time pass models. For each of the classification problems listed above, we selected the “best” models. It is important to recognise that these three solutions are not the only useful ones, however, they were the models that best classified the training data. It is also important to note that we considered the classification profile for each model, rather than just the mean score. It is not uncommon for one classifier (often J48) to perform much worse than the others, therefore if a model performed well with three classifiers and poorly with another that model was preferred to one that performed better on average (i.e., had a greater mean classification accuracy). For example, consider the classification profiles of the following models: Model A - NB = 85, SMO = 90, IBk = 85, J48 = 50 (mean = 77.5) and Model B - NB = 80, SMO = 80, IBk = 80, J48 = 80 (mean = 80). In this example we would prefer Model A to Model B. 3.2.1.5.6 Model testing For the test data set, we used the training data to train the model to predict the class for the test data. The performance of each classifier within the ensemble was then evaluated by the classification rate (percentage accuracy) and inspection of the confusion matrix. For the validation data set, we assigned a voted predicted class for each candidate based on the average predicted class across the classifier ensemble6 for each model developed with the training data. We used the classification rate based on the voted predicted class to evaluate the performance of the model. 3.2.2 Results 3.2.2.1 Getting to assessment within 18 months of training 3.2.2.1.1 Male candidates 3.2.2.1.1.1 Model selection We tested 28 models using the training data; the performance of each model can be seen in Table 3.9. There were three models tied with the best performance, containing 17 unique features. No model contained all 17 features, however, 0 features were included in all three models and 6 features were unique to just one of the three models. Figure 3.4 shows the normalised group means for the training data of the 17 features selected across the models and Table 3.3 shows the unstandardised descriptive statistics.

Across all five classification algorithms, each model classified the test data with 90% accuracy. In each of the three models, case 8 was misclassified by NB, SMO, and IBk and case 3 was misclassified by J48. The fact the models made the same errors is unsurprising given the number of shared attributes. The performance of these three models on the test data is evidence that the model is not over-fitted to the training data, thus increasing our confidence that the variables selected are important discriminatory variables. 3.2.2.1.1.3 Model validation In these data, the performance of the classification algorithms was consistent across both the classifiers and models, but was lower than in the test data (Table 3.4).

To achieve these aims we considered a wide range of potentially relevant variables. The results presented show that there is no one single factor that is important for discriminating candidates and in fact there are some important commonalities between groups, which are likely fundamental for the successful completion of the ML qualification. Some of the discriminatory variables are common to both stages of completion, or to both female and male candidates getting to assessment. 3.2.3.1 Model performance 3.2.3.1.1 Male candidates - Getting to assessment The classification rates for both the training and test data were very good (i.e., approx 90%), however the predictive classification rates were lower (approx 70%). This suggests that the model developed is not over-fitted to the training data, as there is little difference in the training and test classification rates. There are three main reasons this may be: firstly, in the training and test data candidates who had been assessed more than 18 months post-training were excluded from the analyses, these candidates would most likely be misclassified as assessed within 18 months of training EXPLAIN. Secondly, these data were collected from candidates who had completed their training less than 18 months prior to training there are (at least) two plausible reasons for the lower classification rate in the predictive data. Firstly, it is possible that candidates are creating narratives in their minds based on whether or not they have been assessed and that had they answered the survey before being assessed, then their answers may have been different. A second explanation is that because candidates were not at the same point in time when they answered the survey, their answers were different to those they would have given six-months later. For example, a candidate may not have felt that they had made much progress towards becoming an ML 6-12 months post-training and then may make progress in the 12-18 month period. This is not surprising given that group was not included in the training data, thus is arguably a different classification problem. Analysing the data collected from candidates who had not been assessed when the completed the survey but were trained over 18 months ago, may identify a different model. Ideally data would be collected in a proper prospective fashion. The results from this dataset do allow us to place more confidence in the models selected and many of the classification errors may not be important to Mountain Training as some of the candidates who are being misclassified are still going on to be assessed (most within 24 months of their training). 3.2.3.2 Features selected 3.2.3.2.1 GTA Commonalities Several features were common to both the male and female getting to assessment models. At least one model selected for each GTA classification problem contained the following features: Perceived available time Relative ML Importance ML Progress &amp; Relative ML progress Train end assess intention Social/professional change Perceived preparation (&amp; prep_nothing for males) SelfEfficacyDiscrep10 - act according to responsibilities to others The results of the pattern recognition analyses suggest that how becoming an ML fits into candidates’ lives is important in discriminating both female and male candidates who are assessed within 18 months of their training course. Candidates who are assessed within 18 months of their training course were more likely to have: felt that they had enough time to become an ML, felt that becoming an ML was more important than other life goals when registering (becoming an ML was also more important for male candidates who were assessed within 18 months than for male candidates who were not), have made more progress towards becoming an ML, have made more progress towards becoming an ML than towards their other life goals, had a stronger intention of being assessed at the end of their training course, have experiened less change in their life post-training (profesisonal for females and social for males), felt that they had done more to prepare effectively for an assessment. If a candidate feels that becoming an ML is important to them, or that it is more important than other life goals, they may be more likely to commit resources towards it. Time is one such resource, thus those candidates who feel that beomcing an ML is important to them may be more likley to feel that they have more available time to do so. Having more time would also allow candidates to spend mroe time preparing and therefore feel like they had done more to prepare effectivley for an assessment. Whilst we did not collect any data on the exact nautre of changes that candidates’ experienced post-training, the fact they are associated with them not having been assessed would suggest that these changes did not allow candidates to spend more time preparing to become an ML. Candidates who experience changes in their lives post-training 3.2.3.2.2 Male GTA 3.2.3.2.3 Female GTA 3.2.3.2.4 FTP The results presented in Getting to assessment: Male candidates suggest that how becoming an ML fits into male candidates’ lives is important when considering the likelihood of them being assessed. If a candidate feels that becoming an ML is an important life goal, generally or relative to other life goals, they may be more likely to commit time and resources towards it, thus may feel that they can prepare for an assessment in a shorter period of time, which for many, would include revisiting more technical areas of the syllabus like river crossings or practising skills they rarely use like emergency rope work. Candidates who felt that they had more available time to become an ML, had done more to effectively prepare for an ML assessment, had made more progress towards becoming an ML, and were more confident that they could become an ML than to achieve other life goals were more likely to have been assessed 18 months after their training course. Some candidates are less certain in their understanding of the purpose of the ML qualification prior to their training course and may be attending in order to find out more about the qualification, whereas those who are more certain of the purpose are more likely to be doing it in order to progress to an assessment. The strength of candidates’ intentions to be assessed at the end of their training course being an important discriminatory variable is in line with the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen 1991). The Theory of Planned Behaviour suggests that intentions are the strongest predictors of behaviour and that the strength of these intentions also predicts the behaviour (Armitage and Conner 2001). The strength of a candidate’s intention to be assessed at the end of the training course may be more important than their intention at the start because the candidates who were less sure of the purpose of the ML qualification would have had less information to base their intention on. This position is supported by the fact the correlation between being assessed 18 months post-training and the intention to be assessed at the start of the training course (0.1709069) is lower than the correlation between being assessed 18 months post-training and the intention to be assessed at the end of the training course (0.3651245). The results in Expectations and intentions support this, including using prospective data and retrospective data from female candidates, which suggests the strength of intention is important for all candidates, despite not being one of the most important discriminatory variables for female candidates. Candidates who expect it to take them longer to get from training to assessment are less likely to be assessed within a given period7. Candidates may also expect it to take them longer as they either have less available time, live further from the mountains, or a combination of the two, making it more difficult to fit into their lives. If candidates who expect to take longer do take longer, then there will be more opportunities for things to get in the way of them pursuing that goal and becoming barriers to completion. Further, experiencing social change after a training course may mean that candidates have more or less available time, or have changes in their priorities. The question used in the survey did not ask if candidates had more or less resources (e.g., available time) because of this change, however given that more social change a candidate experienced, the less likely they were to be assessed within 18 months, it would be reasonable to assume that these social changes are more likely to leave candidates with less, rather than more, resources to become MLs. PhD delays study found that the effect of having children was greater for men than women (Schoot et al. 2013), supporting another that suggests the same for *** (Waite 1995). In our analyses we used the time of year that courses took place as a proxy measurement of weather and daylight hours. We would expect courses near the New Year to have worse weather and less daylight than those nearer to the middle of the year. Given that candidates who were trained closer to the middle of the year (i.e., June/July) were more likely to have been assessed 18 months after their training course, it is likely that better weather and more daylight on the training course provides candidates with a more positive experience and possibly a better learning environment. To investigate this further, weather data (held on CMS) and daylight hours data should be included in the feature selection stage of a reanalysis of these data. There is a broad literature reporting the benefits of resilience (e.g., Seery and Quinton 2016). Becoming an ML is a difficult process which requires the investment of time, energy, and money and most candidates will have to deal with setbacks during this process. Candidates who are more resilient will be better able to overcome adversity (Smith et al. 2008). For example, bad weather on a training course or changes in life circumstances that become barriers to becoming an ML). It is also a central tenet of self-efficacy theory that people with firmly established self-efficacy beliefs are more resilient (Bandura 1997) as the stronger self-efficacy beliefs are, the easier they are to maintain following disconfirming events. One would normally expect the availability of social support to be a positive influence, however the results in this study suggest that having higher levels of perceived esteem support means that candidates are less likely to have been assessed 18 months after their training course. One explanation for this is that candidates who do not feel that they need esteem support answer this question in a different way to those who do (i.e., they don’t perceive it as available), therefore those who feel they need it score more highly and with less variation in their responses. Another explanation is that esteem support may be reminding male candidates who are unprepared that they are not ready for an assessment. Similar findings, involving the somewhat paradoxical effects of psychological skills and strategies on performance (Roberts et al. 2013), have been reported elsewhere in the literature and do highlight that some support strategies might need to be utilised with caution. Candidates who feel less able to look after themselves and others than they would in an ideal world on steep ground and crossing rivers may feel that they are not ready to pass an assessment and therefore not attend one. For a number of candidates, these skills will be the most specialist mountaineering skills they possess and will have little reason, beyond passing an ML assessment, to practice them. Unless these candidates have spent time deliberately preparing for an assessment, it is likely that they will feel less confident than they would like to at assessment, that they can successfully demonstrate these skills. 3.2.3.3 Female candidates - Getting to assessment As with the results for male candidates, how important becoming an ML is to a candidate, relative to other life goals, is an important discriminatory variable for female candidates. We would expect this variable to have the same implications as those already discussed for male candidates. Again, the more progress that candidates have made towards becoming an ML, the more likely they are to feel that they have prepared effectively for an ML assessment and in doing so, they will have gained experience that boosts their confidence in their abilities to perform task related to the assessment. It is likely that professional change will have similar effects for female candidates as social change does for male candidates. We asked candidates to give two reasons that they had registered for the ML qualification. For their first reason, most candidates said that they had registered in order to become an ML (n.b., this is an extrinsic participatory motive). The candidates who gave an extrinsic participatory motive for their second motive (e.g., “Qualify as an ML)”) rather than a more intrinsic one (e.g., to spend more time in the mountains) were more likely to have been assessed 18 months after their training course. This finding suggests that having more than one extrinsic participatory motive is important for candidates getting to assessment. Goal setting has been shown to improve outcomes in a number of domains (see Weinberg and Gould 2014 p 356). One way that goal setting facilitated by training course staff may have helped candidates is by enabling them to maximise the benefits of the time that they spent consolidating their skills and preparing for an ML assessment after the training course. In addition to this, goal setting may have made it more likely that candidates would prepare for an assessment. The more specific these goals are, the more they will have focused candidates’ attention and efforts towards being at the right level to pass an assessment. Further, goal setting will have helped facilitate mastery experiences (i.e., having an experience where one is successful), the strongest source of self-efficacy (Bandura 1982); thus, this goal setting will have helped female candidates develop their confidence, which as discussed below, is key for female candidates getting to assessment. If candidates feel that becoming an ML is important to them, they may also feel that it is important that they are good enough to pass when they get there. This suggestion helps to explain why candidates who were assessed felt that ideally, they would have a higher number of QMDs at assessment. Another explanation could be that candidates who have not received goal setting support have fewer clear goals and do not feel that they can use the time as efficiently, therefore feel that they would ideally have more QMDs before being assessed. The results presented in Female candidates: Getting to assessment and ML related self-efficacy show that female candidates who are assessed within 18 months of their training have higher levels of self-efficacy pre-assessment than those who are not and that these higher levels of self-efficacy are associated with experience gained after the training course. These items are about areas of the syllabus relating to hazards and emergency procedures, where mistakes may have serious and immediate consequences for other people. It may be especially important for course staff to help female candidates set goals that help them develop their confidence to perform these tasks. Discrepancies between the ideal and post-training levels of self-efficacy were not selected as important discriminatory variables, whilst three of the pre-assessment self-efficacy items were. This would suggest that it is not the discrepancy that is important, but the pre-assessment levels of self-efficacy, which will be influenced by candidates’ experiences and how much preparation they feel that they have done. This hypothesis is supported in Sex differences where there is evidence of a positive relationship between experience and confidence, which is stronger for female candidates than it is for male candidates. It is both interesting and important to note, that 10 of the 11 the features in this discriminatory subset relate to the consolidation period. Considering this combination of variables, the timing of them, and the relationship between the number of QMDs and pre-assessment self-efficacy, the importance of female candidates gaining additional and relevant experience after their training course becomes paramount. 3.2.3.4 Passing first time The further candidates live from a mountainous region, the more difficult it will be for them to gain relevant experience. Furthermore, it is also less likely that they will be able to access support specific to becoming an ML as it is less likely that becoming an ML is normal in their social context. It is clear from analyses not reported here that the first time pass rate for the ML qualification is lower for non-White-European candidates than it is for White-European candidates8 and also that the proportion of non-White-European candidates who are assessed is much lower than the proportion of White-European candidates who are assessed9. There are many plausible explanations for this, which may include social, cultural, and economic factors. However, there is little empirical evidence to support any of them at the moment and it is beyond the scope of this report to examine this issue further. The facilitation of goal setting by course staff was also an important factor for passing first time. In addition to helping candidates set goals, the provision of structure by training staff, by making it clear to candidates what they need to do to be pass an assessment, was important. The provision of structure may have benefited candidates by helping them to set very clear and specific goals, which are more effective than broad and/or vague goals for influencing behaviour change (Gould 2005). There are a number of reasons that extraversion may be linked with passing, including differences in levels of physiological arousal, which can influence the breadth of perceptual cues that individuals pay attention to, and decision making (Hardy, Jones, and Gould 1996). Extraversion has also been linked with effective leadership (Judge et al. 2002). There is also evidence that goal setting reduces the distractibility of extraverts, helping them maintain focus in training (Woodman et al. 2010), therefore, goal setting may be particularly important for extraverted candidates. The ML assessment is a very stressful experience for many candidates. It is unsurprising that received emotional support and perceived esteem support available are positive predictors of passing. Having these types of social support may help candidates cope with the pressure of assessment (Freeman et al. 2014; Freeman, Coffee, and Rees 2011). However, as seen above, perceived esteem support is a predictor of male candidates not getting to assessment. These findings would suggest that esteem support should be used sparingly, or only in the right context (i.e., when candidates are ready to be assessed). Seven of the 23 candidates who did not pass their first assessment were only deferred because they had too few Quality Mountain Days in their logbook at assessment. It is important to highlight that the features presented here discriminate between candidates who do and do not pass their assessment, not between candidates who are and are not good enough to pass an ML assessment, in terms of their skills and decision making. If we removed these particular candidates from the sample, we would have too few cases to perform the analysis, therefore, it is difficult at this juncture to answer the question “Is having more than the minimum experience beneficial for passing an ML assessment.” If anything, it is evidence that one can pass the practical element an ML assessment with fewer than 40 QMDs. The results presented in Passing first time also suggest that candidates who include Quality Hill/Moorland Days in their DLOG are less likely to pass. Whilst it is unlikely that this experience is detrimental to their performance at assessment, Quality Hill/Moorland Days are not as relevant as QMD experience. One explanation for this finding is that candidates who feel they have a weak logbook want to show all the experience that they feel is relevant, whereas a candidate who feels they have a strong logbook may only feel the need to include the experience they feel is most relevant. Further, candidates who live further from the mountains may be trying to prepare for an ML assessment in non-mountainous terrain as it is more accessible to them. Nine of the 10 candidates who attended a Mountain Skills course prior to being assessed and responded to the survey passed their first ML assessment10. This suggests that additional structured training helps candidates to successfully prepare for an assessment. When considering the discriminatory features presented above in a holistic manner, it is important that whilst preparing for their assessment, candidates gain enough relevant experience in the consolidation period, using clear and specific goals developed from training. In addition, it is vital that they are able to cope with the pressures of the assessment process, drawing not only on their experience relevant to the ML qualification (i.e., QMDs), but also social support when necessary. 3.2.3.5 Limitations Several limitations can be identified in this project. Firstly, most of the data used was collected retrospectively. Retrospective data will be less accurate as time increases between the event and when participants are sampled, and people may create their own narrative retrospectively which may or may not reflect reality. An example of this could be a candidate who did not pass their first assessment attributing their failure to the coaching (or lack thereof) they received on their training course. Secondly, there is some evidence of sampling bias in the data used to identify the important discriminatory factors for both getting to assessment and passing. The proportion of female and male candidates who did get to assessment within 18 months of their training course is not the same in the retrospective data (females = 23.21% and males = 41.35%) as it is in the population of candidates trained in the same period (females = 19.02% and males = 30.22%). In addition to this, the proportion of males who did not pass their first assessment is not the same in the retrospective data (13.5%) as it is in the prospective data (19.6%) or in the population11 (19.8%); there is no evidence of the same problem in the data collected from female candidates. The simplest explanation for this is that candidates who are not assessed and male candidates who do not pass their first assessment are less likely to retrospectively respond to the survey. Whilst there may be a subset of candidates that are not represented in the data collected as part of this project, we believe that the findings presented in this report can be used to make a positive impact on the completion rate of the ML qualification. This belief is based not only on the analyses of retrospective and prospective data presented here, but their congruence with the results from the initial qualitative study and existing literature. Reanalysis of these data in the future should mitigate this sampling bias so that the response rate in the prospective data is similar to that in the population and reduce the impact of recall bias. However, a truly prospective study that collected data from candidates at registration, training, and during their consolidation would likely overcome the limitations described above.
