<p>The aim of this study was to identify a suitable measure for each construct identified in Chapter 2 <strong>LINK</strong>, which could then be used to identify the most important variables for discriminating candidates who do complete the ML qualification from those who do not. Given that we wanted to collect data from candidates for 166 variables, using full-length measures of the relevant constructs would be unreasonable for participants. To measure each construct of interest with a full length measure would create a survey so long that few candidates would complete it and those that did would likely not be representative of the population. Horvath and Röthlin <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Horvath2018">2018</a>)</span> discuss additional issues associated with using “basic research questionnaires” that are not best suited to use in an applied sport psychology setting, where instead, one may only want to use a questionnaire as a screening tool, or help provide “a complete picture about an athlete’s situation.” As such we were particularly interested in identifying short-form measures as using such measures was most likely to allow us to create a suitably short survey to collect data with.</p>
<p>The development of short-form measures to reduce the burden on participants has been of interest to researchers for over 100 years <span class="citation">(Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson <a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>)</span>. However, the development of short-form measures has attracted some criticism <span class="citation">(e.g., Levy <a href="#ref-Levy1968">1968</a>; Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson <a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>; Wechsler <a href="#ref-Wechsler1967">1967</a>)</span>. One of the main criticisms of short-form measures has been that “rigorous, valid, comprehensive assessment is crucial for the evaluation and treatment of many psychological problems” <span class="citation">(Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson <a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>, p 102)</span> and that the time saving afforded by a short-form measure does not warrant the loss of validity associated with measuring a construct with fewer items.</p>
<p>When creating, or identifying, a short-form measure one should not assume that the evidence for the validity and reliability of the original measure applies to the short-from, therefore it is important to provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the short-form <span class="citation">(Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson <a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>)</span>. This evidence should include, but is not limited to, reliability of the short-from, shared variance between the full- and short-form measure, content validity/coverage of the construct, and also that the reduction in items offers a meaningful reduction in the time taken for the measure to be completed <span class="citation">(Horvath and Röthlin <a href="#ref-Horvath2018">2018</a>; Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson <a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This project’s aim was to identify the most important discriminatory variables for identifying candidates who do or do not complete the ML qualification using Machine Learning techniques rather than testing the relationships between variables using regression based techniques or structural equation modelling. Therefore, instead of using full-length measures to collect data for each construct, we used one or two item <em>indicators</em> for each construct, unless a suitable short-form measure existed <span class="citation">(e.g., the Ten Item Personality Inventory Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann <a href="#ref-Gosling2003">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="method-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1</span> Method</h3>
<div id="procedure-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.1</span> Procedure</h4>
<p>Although using full measures was not a realistic aim in the project, we still felt that the reliability and validity of the indicators that we would use was paramount. Researchers have suggested a variety of ways in which short-form measures can be developed whilst remaining both reliable and valid. Considering the guidance provided by <span class="citation">Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson (<a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Horvath and Röthlin (<a href="#ref-Horvath2018">2018</a>)</span> along with the aim of this research, we used the steps below to identify items which would be used to collect data from candidates.</p>
<p>Our first choice was to identify existing suitable short-form measure. When this was not possible, but there was an existing measure that we were able to access secondary data for, we used the following steps. Firstly, we checked that existing measure did measure the construct of interest and that there was sufficient evidence for its reliability and validity. Secondly, we identified which items we wanted to retain based on both content validity and factor loadings. It was important that the items retained still provided adequate coverage of the construct. In some instances, this meant retaining an item which had a (relatively) low factor loading, but measured a unique aspect of that construct, was more important than it was to retain items with high factor loadings. This will necessarily have lowered the reliability coefficient for the short-form measure, however, it is important to note that internal consistency is only one aspect of valididty. If we did not feel that this process left us with items that provided adequate coverage of the construct of interest, we made a note of how the new, narrower, construct differed from the original.</p>
<p>Once we had identifed the items we wished to retain, we fitted a single factor latent variable model for both the full- and short-form measure to the secondary data, using <code>lavaan</code> <span class="citation">(Rosseel and Jorgensen <a href="#ref-R-lavaan">2020</a>)</span>, to estimate factor scores for each participant. These factor scores were then used to calculate a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted factor sores for full- and short-form measure as an estimate of shared variance. We believe that this method is better than correlating the item sum-scores as latent variables account for measurement error, thus, reducing the likelihood of receiving an optimistically biased estimate due to error correlation. Shared variance with the full measure was our main concern for this study as if the correlations are high enough then the two measures can be thought of as approximately equal <span class="citation">(Smith, McCarthy, and Anderson <a href="#ref-Smith2000">2000</a>)</span>. Finally, we calculated the composite reliability for the new short-form measure <span class="citation">(<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>; Fornell and Larcker <a href="#ref-Fornell1981">1981</a>)</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If secondary data were not available but we identified a suitable measure, we chose the best item(s) based on face validity of the items and factor loadings reported in the original paper validating the full measure. Finally, if none of the options above were possible, we developed item(s) within the research team in collaboration with Mountain Training UKI.</p>

<li>To measure the “Big-Five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and emotional stability), we used the Ten Item Personality Inventory <span class="citation">(TIPI; Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann <a href="#ref-Gosling2003">2003</a>)</span>. The TIPI comprises ten pairs of items (e.g., “Critical, quarrelsome”), one positively worded and one negatively worded for each trait. Each item has the same stem, “I see myself as…” Participants are then asked to score each item on a seven-point Likert scale from “Disagree strongly” (1) to “Agree strongly” (7) and sum scores are calculated for each of the five traits.</li>

<p>Perceived self-efficacy is domain specific and individuals will have varying levels of self-effiacy beliefs across different domains of their lives, therefore it is important that any measure of perceived self-efficacy is domain specific <span class="citation">(Bandura <a href="#ref-Bandura1997">1997</a>, <a href="#ref-Bandura2006">2006</a>)</span>. Mountain Training provide clear documentation about what will be required of candidates during their assessment, this includes a candidate handbook and syllabus <span class="citation">(Mountain Training UK <a href="#ref-MountainTrainingUK2015a">2015</a><a href="#ref-MountainTrainingUK2015a">b</a>)</span>, and a separate skills checklist <span class="citation">(Mountain Training UK <a href="#ref-MountainTrainingUK2015">2015</a><a href="#ref-MountainTrainingUK2015">a</a>)</span>. The first author conducted an inductive content analysis <span class="citation">(Cho and Lee <a href="#ref-Cho2014">2014</a>)</span> of these documents to identify a list of skills, which should be able to perform on an ML assessment. This list of skills was then discussed with Mountain Training UKI who agreed that it provided good coverage of the skills that would be covered on an assessment.</p>
<p>Using the list of skills, a self-efficacy scale was created following Bandura’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Bandura2006">2006</a>)</span> guidelines. The resultant scale was then piloted with Mountain Training UKI staff who provided feedback on the items, which was then collated and used to refine the scale. The final scale was made up of eleven items (e.g., “lead a group effectively in the mountains”) rated on a scale of 0 (could not do at all) to 100 (highly certain could do) with a mid-point anchor (50; moderately could do). The items could then be presented to participants three times, each with a different introduction as we wanted to measure efficacy at two points along the pathway and also candidates’ ideal efficacy levels:</p>

All of us have a number of personal projects at any given time that we think about, plan for, and sometimes (though not always) complete.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to think about the projects or goals that you were working on before your assessment, these may include things that you have already told us about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants were then given examples of goals (e.g., “Completing another outdoor qualification,” “Spending more time with my family”) and asked to “write down the two goals that you were most likely to work towards in the six-months before your assessment, <em>not-including</em> becoming an ML.” On the following page, for each of their stated goals and for the goal of “becoming an ML,” they were then asked to rate the: importance of the goal, “not at all important to me” (0) to “extremely important to me” (100); progress towards the goal in the last six months/six months before their assessment, “no progress” (0) to “most progress” (100); and their perceived self-efficacy of attaining the goal, “I definitely do/did not have” (0) to “I definitely have/had” (100).</p>
<p>Using the scores provided, the following can then be calculated: relative importance, relative progress, and relative efficacy score using the following formula<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Relative = \frac{Mountain\,Leader + 1 }{(Goal\,1 + Goal\,2) \div 2 + 1}

<div id="motives" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.2.5</span> Motives</h5>
<p>In Chapter 2 it appeared that two different levels of motive were important to the completion of the ML qualification: participatory (the goal content) and regulatory (the “why”). To measure the participatory motives, we employed a similar methodology to Sheldon and Elliot’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Sheldon1999">1999</a>)</span> adaptation of Little’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Little1983">1983</a>)</span> Personal Project Analysis. First, we asked participants to list two goals that they hoped to achieve by registering for the ML qualification. These reasons were then coded by the first author on a scale of definitely intrinsic (1) to definetly extrinsic (5) and a mean score was calculated. Examples for each value are as follows: (1) “To have fun,” (2) “Being better equipped to enjoy the mountains safely for myself,”(3) “Assessing my own ability,”(4) “Confidence in leading groups in the moutnains,”(5) “Gain the ML qualification.”</p>
<p>On the next page of the survey participants were asked to rate each reason they had given in terms of their behavioural regulation. Each item had the same stem, “I pursue this goal because…” The intrinsic item was “of the fun and enjoyment it provides me,” the integrated reason was “it is a part of who I am or aspire to be,” the identified reason was “I really believe it’s an important goal to have,” the interjected reason was “I would feel ashamed, guilty, or anxious if I didn’t,” the external reason was “someone else wants me to or because the situation demands it.” Participants scored each of these reasons on a visual analogue scale with five equally spaced anchors from strongly agree (0) to strongly disagree (100), a mean score for each of the regulatory motives was then calculated.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.2.10</span> Preparation for assessment</h5>
<p>Preparation for an assessment may encompass a variety of different things for different candidates and we were interested in how much candidates felt that they had done to prepare for an assessment. We asked participants to complete the sentence, “I have done ____ to prepare effectively for an ML assessment” using a visual analogue scale, anchored at “nothing” and “all that I could.” Given the complex nature of this question, we first asked participants to list some of the things that they had done in the last six-months/six-months prior to their assessment to prepare. This was done to help improve accuracy in responses in a similar fashion to the decomposition questions used in The World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire <span class="citation">(Kessler et al. <a href="#ref-Kessler2003a">2003</a>; Means and Loftus <a href="#ref-Means1991">1991</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="life-events" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.2.11</span> Life events</h5>
<p>Based on the results of Chapter 2, we wanted to measure change in three domains of candidates lives: social, professional, and health. The Recent Life Change Questionnaire <span class="citation">(RLCQ; Miller and Rahe <a href="#ref-Miller1997">1997</a>)</span> has items covering these domains. At this point, we were not concerned about the exact events that may, or may not, have occurred, therefore we presented items from the RLCQ as examples for each domain and then asked participants to rate the extent to which they had experienced change in that domain of their life since their training course using a visual analogue scale (no change to major change). Another consideration when choosing this method was the sensitive nature of some life events. Allowing participants to indicate a magnitude of perceived change rather than explicitly responding to a sensitive item (e.g., “Miscarriage or abortion,” “Being held in jail”) was deemed more appropriate for this study.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.1.3</span> Discussion</h3>
<p>Study 1 identified suitable short measures for each construct of interest. Whilst this study significantly reduced the number of items that participants would be required to answer, there were still too many to ask a single participant to answer. Including all of the items identified thus far would require candidates to spend approximately 21 minutes answering questions; participants would also be required to read the information sheet, transition between pages, etc. Therefore, Study 2 sought to reduce the number of constructs, by identifying those which were not important discriminatory variables.</p>

<div id="study-2---item-reduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">A.2</span> Study 2 - Item reduction</h2>
<p>Having selected appropriate items for the variables we wanted to collect data for, we were left with an item pool of 186, which was deemed too many to ask any individual participant as most would not complete the survey and those who did, would probably not be representative of the population. Therefore, we created four surveys, each of which contained a subset of the variables that we wanted to collect data for. Each variable was included in at least two of the surveys and each pairwise combination of variables was included in at least one survey. This was done to both collect as much data as possible and also to ensure that two-way interactions could be explored.</p>

<p>Once data collection was complete, each of the four groups was then split in two, one group for those candidates who had DLOG data and one group who did not have DLOG data. This was done as the pattern recognition procedure cannot handle missing data and we would then have had to omit all DLOG data, which would have left us unable to identify interactions between the survey and experience data. Once the groups had been split into these two groups, we created two data sets within each one for those who did not and then for each classification problem. This resulted in the following data sets for each survey group:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Getting to assessment within 18 months of training - no DLOG data</li>
<li>Getting to assessment within 18 months of training - with DLOG data</li>

<p>In our data (and the population), most candidates have not been assessed 18 months after their training course. To ensure an orthogonal design (i.e., both groups were of equal size) we selected a random sample of candidates who had not been assessed 18 months after their training course of equal size to the group of candidates who had been assessed.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.2.1.2</span> Analytical method - pattern recognition</h4>
<p>We used pattern recognition analyses to identify the most important discriminatory variables within each group; by identifying the most important, we were able to infer which variables were not important discriminatory variables. Pattern recognition analyses, originally developed in bioinformatics <span class="citation">(Duda, Hart, and Stork <a href="#ref-Duda2000">2000</a>)</span>, use machine learning algorithms to identify a set of discriminatory features (variables), which can be used to identify the class of an object. Pattern recognition analysis is more appropriate for these data than “traditional” methods (e.g., discriminant function analyses) as they employ both linear and non-linear functions and therefore reflect multiple and complex interactions and not just “main-effects”. Pattern recognition analyses have also been used in a number of recent studies to examine differences between athletes of different performance levels <span class="citation">(e.g., Güllich et al. <a href="#ref-Gullich2019">2019</a>; B. D. Jones et al. <a href="#ref-Jones2019a">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>More specifically, we used a pattern recognition procedure that has been developed for analysing what are known as <em>short and wide</em> data sets <span class="citation">(i.e., data sets that contain more variables than cases; Jones, Hardy, and Kuncheva <a href="#ref-Jones2017a">2017</a>)</span>. This procedure is a three-part process. First, we aimed to identify a set of features which correlated well with the class but had a low correlation with one another (feature selection). Then we tested the ability of this feature subset to correctly classify the candidates according to the criterion variable for that analysis (classification). Finally, we refined the feature subset to identify the simplest solution that best explained the data (recursive feature elimination).</p>
<p>We carried out the pattern recognition procedure outlined above twice for each of the four pilot surveys. The first set of analyses identified the most important features for discriminating candidates who get to assessment within 18 months of their training from those who do not. The second set of analyses identified the features which best discriminated candidates who passed their first assessment from those who did not.</p>
<p>Analyses were carried out using WEKA 3-9-3 open source software issued under the GNU General Public License version 3 <span class="citation">(Bouckaert et al. <a href="#ref-Bouckaert2018">2018</a>; Frank, Hall, and Witten <a href="#ref-Frank2016">2016</a>)</span>. WEKA is a machine learning workbench with a collection of algorithms widely used for data mining, machine learning, and pattern recognition.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.2.1.2.1</span> Pre-processing</h5>
<p>For feature selection and model identification, it is important that good quality data is used and that there are no missing values <strong>REF</strong>. Where there was missing data, we had a choice, remove the case or remove the variable<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. The choice of removing the case or variable was decided by the amount of missing data within the variable in an effort to use as much data as possible. Where there were few cases with missing data for that variable, we removed the cases and where there were many cases with missing data for that variable, we removed the variable. Once each of the 16 data sets had been cleaned, the data were standardised within sex using the <code>mousetrap</code> package <span class="citation">(Kieslich et al. <a href="#ref-R-mousetrap">2019</a>)</span>, to control for sex differences<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="feature-selection-1" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.2.1.2.2</span> Feature Selection</h5>
<p>Best practice guidelines for short and wide data recommend that feature selection is carried out using a number of different methods <span class="citation">(Jones, Hardy, and Kuncheva <a href="#ref-Jones2017a">2017</a>)</span>. With this in mind we used four feature selection algorithms: Correlation Feature Subset with a Best First Evaluator <span class="citation">(CFS; Hall <a href="#ref-Hall1999">1999</a>)</span>, Correlation Attribute Evaluator <span class="citation">(CAE; Bouckaert et al. <a href="#ref-Bouckaert2018">2018</a>)</span>, Relief-f <span class="citation">(Kira and Rendell <a href="#ref-Kira1992">1992</a>)</span>, and Support Vector Machine - Recursive Feature Elimination <span class="citation">(SVM-RFE; Guyon, Weston, and Barnhill <a href="#ref-Guyon2002">2002</a>)</span>. CAE, Relief-f, and SVM-RFE rank all variables in order of merit (magnitude of relationship), whereas CFS selects a subset of features that are highly correlated with the class but not with one another. As only CFS provides a subset of features, the top 20 features were selected from the rankings provided by the other three algorithms (as long as the attribute merit was greater than zero).</p>
<p>These analyses were carried out in a centralised fashion, with all variables being included at the same time <span class="citation">(Bolón-Canedo, Sánchez-Maroño, and Alonso-Betanzos <a href="#ref-Bolon-Canedo2015a">2015</a><a href="#ref-Bolon-Canedo2015a">a</a>)</span>. We employed a <em>leave-one-out cross-validation</em> (LOO-CV) protocol, a special case of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-fold cross-validation, where <span class="math inline">\(K = N\)</span>, as it reduces the impact of each object on the feature selection process by increasing the generalisability of the model <span class="citation">(Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman <a href="#ref-Hastie2009">2009</a>)</span>. Each data set was split into <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> parts or <em>folds</em>, with each part having an approximately equal number of cases. The <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>th fold is then removed from the data and the feature selection algorithm is then applied to the remaining data, with each feature being assigned a merit score (or being selected/not for CFS), once this has been repeated <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> times the merit score for each attribute is averaged across the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> iterations.</p>
<p>All of these are well established feature selection methods and the most important point to note about these four methods is that each works in very a different way. Therefore, the greater the number of algorithms which select a feature, the more confident one can be that it is important as it is less likely that the feature has been chosen by chance <span class="citation">(Visa et al. <a href="#ref-Visa2011">2011</a>)</span>. For each of the 16 data sets this process yielded a number feature subsets, one containing those features which had been selected by at least two feature selection algorithms (2s), another containing those features which had been selected by at least three feature selection algorithms (3s), and where possible a third subset where features has been selected by all four algorithms (4s).</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-classification-1" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.2.1.2.3</span> Initial Classification</h5>
<p>For each of the feature subsets, we carried out <em>initial classification</em> experiments. Each of these experiments used four different classification algorithms with their default settings and LOO-CV: Naïve Bayes <span class="citation">(NB; John and Langley <a href="#ref-John1995">1995</a>)</span>, Sequential Minimal Optimization <span class="citation">(SMO; Platt <a href="#ref-Platt1998">1998</a>)</span>, Instance Based Learning <span class="citation">(IBk; Aha, Kibler, and Albert <a href="#ref-Aha1991">1991</a>)</span>, J48 Decision Tree <span class="citation">(J48; Quinlan <a href="#ref-Quinlan1993">1993</a>)</span>. As with feature selection, the more consistent the results from each algorithm (classification accuracy) for a feature subset, the more confidence we can place in the predictive validity of that subset.</p>
<p>An important point to note that as all of the data have been seen during the feature selection stage the classification rates may be slightly higher than they would be for previously unseen data <span class="citation">(Kuncheva and Rodríguez <a href="#ref-Kuncheva2018">2018</a>; Smialowski, Frishman, and Kramer <a href="#ref-Smialowski2010">2010</a>)</span>. However, in this instance, the aim is not to create a predictive model, but to identify which features should be retained to create a survey tool and classification rates are only being used to compare the predictive power of feature subsets from the same data set - any inflation of classification rates will be shared by the feature subsets under consideration.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-classification-1" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">A.2.1.2.4</span> Final Classification</h5>
<p>Having conducted the initial classification experiments, we sought to identify more parsimonious models, potentially with higher classification accuracies using the Recursive Elimination Method <span class="citation">(Guyon, Weston, and Barnhill <a href="#ref-Guyon2002">2002</a>)</span>. To do so we took each feature subset with more than five features in, examined the normalised SMO weight provided by the SMO classifier and removed the feature with the lowest weight before re-running the four classifiers on the, now smaller, feature subset. This continued in an iterative fashion until all features with a SMO weight &gt; .3 had been removed, the iteration with the best classification rate was then retained.</p>

<div id="results-3" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.2.2</span> Results</h3>
<div id="classification-rates" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.2.2.1</span> Classification rates</h4>
<p>In 15 of the 16 datasets we were able identify a feature subset which could be used to correctly classify candidates with at least <em>good</em> accuracy (i.e., at least one classifier for that data set had a classification rate over 70%). For the other data set we were able to identify a feature subset which could be used to classify candidates with <em>moderate</em> accuracy (i.e., at least one classifier for that data set had a classification rate over 60%, Table <a href="key-discrimantory-factors.html#tab:study-2-classification-rates">3.8</a>).</p>
<p>Having identified a number of feature subsets that could be used to classify candidates in each group, we identified the items which we wanted to retain for the final survey. As not all items were asked to the same number of groups, we scored each item by the number of times that it was selected divided by the number of times it was asked. This was done so that the item retention process was not biased by the number of times that an item was asked. Items were retained if they were selected for the best models in at least half of the datasets they were asked to.</p>
<p>Of the 150 variables, 66 variables were retained based on the criteria above. Some of these variables were sum totals of constructs including variables not selected, therefore we chose to retain a further 23 variables. This process resulted in 134 items being retained for the final survey (see <strong>APPENDIX</strong> for a list of the variables retained for the final survey).</p>

<div id="discussion-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.2.3</span> Discussion</h3>
<p>This study sought to create a survey tool which could be administered to candidates who had completed an ML training course in order to help us identify the most important discriminatory variables for candidates who: (a) did or did not get to an assessment within 18 months of their training course and (b) did or did not pass their first assessment. Whilst no single candidate provided data for all of the variables, we were able to discriminate candidates with a degree of accuracy substantially greater than chance. The findings shows that firstly the measures used in the survey work, and secondly, that we collected data about variables which explain some of the variance in the criterion variables. It is important to note that just because a construct has not been selected, it is not necissarialy unimportant. Variables not selected as discriminatory variables may infact be important commonalities between the groups. The next study collected data from candidates who attended an ML training course between 2016 and 2018 on all of the variables retained following this study.</p>
<p>Including DLOG data in the models did not appear to improve the classification rates in any substantive way. This suggests that the variance explained by those data is better explained by survey variables. A likely explanation for this is that candidates use the DLOGs in different ways. Some candidates will log every experience that they have, some will log only the best of their experiences, some will log only their relevant experience, and some will log only the experience they need to meet the pre-requites for the course (potentially from an extremely large pool of experience). The use of DLOG in these different ways creates messy data, with no easy way to distinguish a candidate who only has 40 QMDs and a candidate who has far more than that but only logs 40 as they do not feel it would benefit them to log more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Ross: This implies to me that if there were two items to measure a construct (for example) you put each item and the sum total of the construct into the analysis. If this is what you did (which I am pretty sure it is), I think its important that earlier you make this point clear and explain why it is appropriate/good.)</p>

<li id="fn12"><p>Horvath and Röthlin <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Horvath2018">2018</a>)</span> highlight the fact that a measure of internal consistency such as Cronbach’s alpha may be lower for a short-form measure simply because it has fewer items, therefore this may be a less useful metric than it would be in a longer measure. Composite reliability does not include the number of items in its calculation therefore is more suitable for assessing the internal consistency of short-form measures.<a href="developing-the-survey-tool.html#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Different wording was presented to candidates based on whether or not they had been assessed.<a href="developing-the-survey-tool.html#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>To avoid returning an undefined value one is added to both the numerator and denominator.<a href="developing-the-survey-tool.html#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Imputing values would not be appropriate for these data as this was usually due to candidate: (a) not having completed the survey, (b) having had an atypical journey through the pathway (e.g., received an exemption from training), or (c) provided an inappropriate answer for a question.<a href="developing-the-survey-tool.html#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>We considered exploring the data having standardised them by training provider, however, we felt that the variance in number of candidates trained by each provider was too high.<a href="developing-the-survey-tool.html#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
